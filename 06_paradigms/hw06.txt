HW06 -- Paradigms/Printing Hello World in different languages
2021-09-28

Scheme:
(display "Hello World!")

Netlogo:
print "Hello World!"

Python:
print("Hello World!")

3. All of us used the same code for Python and Scheme.

4. One of our trio members used a different command for Netlogo and I didn't know there were multiple ways to print in Netlogo
