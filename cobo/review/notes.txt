1a. public static sentimentVal( String )
1b. This method requires a String parameter. If you pass a different parameter, it will return 0.
1c. This method returns a double.

2.
Method Call                 Return value

hands                       0.69
handsome                    2.12
handy                       2.28

3a. It will compile.
3b. It will not compile because sentimentVal does take floats as parameters and it doesn't return a string.
3c. It will not compile because sentimentVal cannot take 2 parameters.

ACTIVITY 2
==========

1. created method totalSentiment
2. Tested SimpleReview.txt file with content:

"This was a terrible restaurant! The pizza crust was too chewy,
and I disliked the pasta. I would definitely not come back."

and got -2.92

3. Made starRating and tested with:

"This was a terrible restaurant! The pizza crust was too chewy,
and I disliked the pasta. I would definitely not come back."

and got 2

4. totalSentiment works by starting at index 0 of the string returned by
textToString() and then iterating through until a space is found, when a space is found,
you create an int variable temp and store the current value of index. Then you keep on iterating
until you find another space. Then the code will remove the puncuation of
content.substring(temp, index) and find the sentimentValue of that word and add it to
the double totalSentiment. It will keep on iterating until index is no longer less than
content.size()

5a. I think that they make sense
5b. take into account punctuation like exclamantion points, and sometimes positive words dont
mean positive rating, for e.g "this restaurant is not the best"

6. He did not take into account for a negative sentimentVal.

3. indexOf is a method in the String class that finds the index of the first instance of the string input.
substring is a method in the String class that can take one or two integer parameters. If it is given one integer parameter,
it will return a substring starting from index of that parameter to the end of the string. If given two integer parameters,
it will return a substring starting from index of the initial parameter to one less of the index of the other parameter. This
is exactly why it is necessary to add 1 to the position of the space when copying the remained of the string.

5. Static methods belongs to a class and can be used in any instance of a class, while a non-static method can access any
static methods/variables without needing an instance of the class.

6. We could just replace the randomAdjective call with randomNegativeAdj or randomPositiveAdj.

ACTIVITY 4
==========

1. You would want to auto generate negative reviews when you want to make a tom foolery of other businesses.

2. You would want to auto generate positive reviews when you are trying to boost ratings of a product.

3. We decided to have a more positive review. To do this, we would replace all neutral and negative adjectives with positive adjectives.
This will result in an overall stronger positive review.

5. oneWord will be replaced by a substring that starts at index 1 inclusive and ends at the end of oneWord.

6. In the actual list, there are no words with the * character in front of it.

7. To create a super positive review, you can just replace the neutral / negative adjectives with adjectives with a sentimentVal of
greater than 1 or some other arbitrary number.
