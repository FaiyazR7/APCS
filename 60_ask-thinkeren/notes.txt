Time spent: .2 hrs

DISCO:
Processors must not actively sort cards, just carry out give or recieve as straying from task would result in the entire system breaking down. 

QCC:
Can a thinkeren receive multiple decks if he gives away orginial deck given to him for sorting?

THINKER FIRMWARE:
-if given cards, take cards
-if card # > 1, split your cards and give each half to other thinkeren
-if card # = 1, give it back to the thinkeren who gave it to you
-if you have 2 decks, combine decks into one and return to thinkeren who gave it to you. 

HOW TO CLEAN UP:
-standardize a way to give cards so it requires minimum time to give away decks to others.
